# AI-Movie-Recommendation-System
A content-based AI Movie Recommendation System built with Python and Streamlit. It recommends similar movies using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. Users can search by title or genre, view posters and details via the TMDB API, watch trailers, and save favorites using a built-in watchlist.
